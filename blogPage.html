        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Dummy text: Its function as a filler or as a tool for comparing the visual impression of different typefaces
            Dummy text is text that is used in the publishing industry or by web designers to occupy the space which
            will later be filled with 'real' content. This is required when, for example, the final text is not yet
            available. Dummy text is also known as 'fill text'. It is said that song composers of the past used dummy
            texts as lyrics when writing melodies in order to have a 'ready-made' text to sing with the melody. Dummy
            texts have been in use by typesetters since the 16th century.

        <h2>More about it</h2>
        <p>
            Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be
            distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
            The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
            distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
            here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
            packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model
            text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still
            in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,
            sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the
            like). Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum
            is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
            literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
            McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
            looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem
            Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
            literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from
            sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The
            Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a
            treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
            The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes
            from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used
            since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections
            1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are
            also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English
            versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham. Where can I get some?
            There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the
            majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or
            randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are
            going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
            anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
            generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as
            necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses
            a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model
            sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The
            generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected
            humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
