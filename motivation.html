                Now-a-days, sticking to our goal has become very challenging due to loads of pressure on an inidividual
                be
                it student or working professional. Here's when 90% of people give up their dreams and complaint about
                the
                situation and <strong>luck factor</strong>. Remember <em>"Luck is nothing but opportunity met by
                    prepared"</em>. Here's my view on it and how I deal with it.
            </p>
            <h2 id="about">More about it</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp; In this modern technological world, there are n number of things to distract us from our goal.
                The
                important
                thing is whether we get distracted by them or not. So for dealing with this, one must have enormous and
                dedicated concentration. For that I
                get up early in the morning and do <strong>meditation</strong> and keep telling myself <strong>"You are
                    gonna be successful no matter what"</strong>. This concentric approach is inspired from our former
                great
                Prime Minister late <strong>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</strong> whom I admire a lot.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp; It may happen that sometimes may situations get lot of tough and you feel like giving up. I am no
                exception
                I have also felt this many times. But in order to tackle this I read the biographys of our greatly
                determined <strong>martryred soldiers</strong>, and I don't know why but I get fired up and there's a
                certain boost of energy level from within. I feel like what I am doing is nothing in comparison to our
                great
                soldiers who never thought of defeat for even a bit. And this thought fuels me ðŸ˜…, and I find myself
                very
                productive and attentive to what Ido.
            </p>

                &emsp; Lastly, people often take too much of a burden and stress on themselves and looses their main
                goal.
                When you
                doubt yourselves , you have lost then and there. For this I would suggest you to read <strong>"Bhagwath
                    Geeta"</strong>. Such a beauty, it tells us how to tackle each and every aspect of life. In it,
                <em>Shri
                    Krishna's</em> verses starts and end with same word that says <strong><em>"Don't
                        Worry"</em></strong>.
                "Karam karte jaa fal ki chinta na kar" it's a line with a deep meaning.
